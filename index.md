**Thank you for coming and checking on our kitties. Here are some of the things that would be great to do for our boys:**

1. Put one can of wet food in each bowl (2 cans total)
    - Cat food is in the drawer next to the dry catfood container.
2. Make sure dry food is full.
3. Clean litter box in master bathroom.
    - If it isn't too bad you don't need to do this both days. Wednesday only is fine.

_Optional Kitty Time_
- I left Oliver and Finn's favorite feather and wormy toy in the drawer with the wet food.
- You can also give them the Tempatations treats I left on the counter in the kitchen.

**Also, Jules garden could really use some water, these are the steps:**

1. Turn on the faucet by fence, the tube will drip slowly in the garden bed.
2. Let run for 30-40 minutes then turn off.

**Please enjoy any snacks or beverages available in the pantry and fridge. There should be cold water bottles and Coors Light. You can also break open that bottle of Blantons above the fridge!**

**Thanks again brotha. :)**
