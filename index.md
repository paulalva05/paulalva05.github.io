# Cat and Water Schedule

Hey Chadders, 

Thank you for coming and checking on our kitties. Here are some of the things that would be great to do for our boys:

1. Put one can of wet food in each bowl (2 cans total)
    - Cat food is in the drawer next to the dry catfood container.
2. Make sure dry food is full.
3. Clean litter box in master bathroom.
    - If it isn't too bad you don't need to do this both days. Wednesday only is fine.
4. Play with feather or wormy, toy can be found in the top left drawer in hall closet.
5. If you also want to give them treats I left the Temptations on the counter in the kitchen.

Also, if you have time. If you could also water Jules garden, these are the steps:

1. Turn on faucet by fence.
2. Let run for 30-40 minutes.
3. Turn off.

Please enjoy any snacks or beverages available in the pantry and fridge. Including the Blatons above the fridge!

Thanks again brotha. :)
